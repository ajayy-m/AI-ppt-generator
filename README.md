This is an intelligent Python-based tool that creates professional PowerPoint presentations using AI. It automatically generates slide content, fetches relevant high-quality images, and builds a `.pptx` file using randomly selected templates.

> Built with 💡 Google Gemini API + Google Custom Search + python-pptx.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `python-pptx`
- `Pillow`
- `requests`
- `google-generativeai`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-pptx pillow requests google-generativeai
````

## 🔧 Setup


 Create a folder named `templates` in the root directory and add at least one `.pptx` template file.

Add your API keys in the script:

   ```python
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_custom_search_api_key"
   SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = "your_search_engine_id"
   GEMINI_API = "your_google_gemini_api_key"
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
main.py
```

1. Enter the topic of your presentation.
2. Enter the number of slides (minimum 3).
3. Choose a template when prompted.
4. The script will generate a `.pptx` file in the current directory.
